# Jackfruit
It's a Question Set Editor.

Initially designed for editing Coconut question sets, but hopefully will support Gooseberry ones as well.

It can run as a static web site that directly accesses question set documents hosted on a CouchDB.

Jackfruit is the canonical source documenting Question Sets and their options.

Clone it
npm install
